[Dragon](http://dragon.seetatech.com) is a **C**(Computation)**G**(Graph)**V**(Virtual)**M**(Machine) based distributed deep learning framework.
It fuses several modern frameworks and integrations together, powered by a unified engine.
The computation between different programming styles is deterministic and reproduceable.

It is the first deep learning framework that focuses on developing multiple styles, rather than
promoting internal interfaces. We will always learn from the AI community to evolve Dragon over time.
