## WHAT'S Dragon?

Dragon is a **C**(Computation)**G**(Graph)**V**(Virtual)**M**(Machine) based distributed deep learning framework.

Our goal is to reduce the unnecessary structures or interfaces. Therefore, in addition to feed or fetch, the last thing is designing a objective function through all available operators.

Besides, we demonstrate that a cross-frameworks frontend(**Deep Learning VirtualBox**) is feasible, and further more, will get benefit from all participating crucial interfaces especially when one is not reasonable.

## WHY NOT Original DL Frameworks?

I was always confused in my childhood of studying DeepLearning:
Â 
```python
import theano
import caffe
import tensorflow
import torch
```
Too stupied, ISN'T?

One day, I saw a JOKE:

```python
# FXCK TF
# KEEP CALM AND USE PYTORCH
import tensorflow as torch
```

So, I made it:

```python
import dragon.vm.theano as theano
import dragon.vm.caffe as caffe
import dragon.vm.tensorflow as tensorflow
import dragon.vm.torch as torch
```

WOW, I could use ALL above DL Frameworks all together!
